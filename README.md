# AzureFormPage

## A Static GitHub Pages page

This is a static webpage that is meant to act as the frontend for an Azure functions trigger. 
If the form doesn't work, try waiting 30 seconds and try again. The server sometimes goes to sleep. 


*Will insert repo link to the azure function here once repo can be made public*
